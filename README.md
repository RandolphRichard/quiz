## Personal description

* The Quiz assignment respect the requirements. I have created 11 questions on a separate Javascript. Having different files for different purposes, helped me stay focus and retrieve where I left off. It was a tough assignment.
* You will lose 10 second on every wrong answer.
* The questions are tricky, but being on the Bootcamp and practice daily will help you find this game really fun.
* I have added different styling codes to make it appeealing. 
* I have added an extra at the end when you find your score, it will be a zoom out after 2 second , the score will zoom in.
* Added Little effect on the Buttons.
* You can add your initial to up to 2 letters
